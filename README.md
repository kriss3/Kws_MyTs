# TypeScript. This is my effort to keep learning TS

## This repo is based on the LI course by Jess Chadwick. 
I will add minor modifications to it to apply what I already know and learn new things along the way.

At the same time, I'm using other tools like VS Code and GitHub Desktop to learn a few new tricks.
